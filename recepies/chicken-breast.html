        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth or water</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>Step</strong>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                
            <li><strong>Step</strong>
            Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>

            <li><strong>Step</strong>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. 
            Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 
            about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

            <li><strong>Step</strong>
            Remove chicken to a plate. Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned 
            bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to 
            dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>

            <li><strong>Step</strong>
           To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
