        <ol>

            <strong>Step</strong>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>

            Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth.

            <li><strong>Step</strong>
            Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>

            <li><strong>Step</strong>
            Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>

            <li><strong>Step</strong>
